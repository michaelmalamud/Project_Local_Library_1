# Local Library 

## Context
This is a record-keeping application for a small library. It provides pertinent information about the library accounts and the books themselves. 

## User 
Users would be people who are responsible for managing the library.

## Use 
Get information about accounts, such as the books that they have borrowed. Keep a record of what books the library owns that are actually in the library. Other similar uses are covered as well.

## Features
Functions that can be called to get specific records such as those mentioned above. 

## Technologies and Tools
Vanilla JS, array methods

## Discoveries 
This project was instrumental in giving me more comfort with getting data out of arrays, objects, or some combination of both. Specifically, I became more comfortable with functions like find() and filter(), and later, with more complex functions such as map() and reduce(). 

## Future Goals 
The code can certainly be refactored to be made more efficient and reflect the DRY principle.
